Are you learning game development?

Sometimes, I forget the simplest of syntax needed to make a character to do basic things

I'll provide all the files I find helpful for a game you may be working on, along with resources to learn more about the topic attempted in the file

I'll be making my own game but I will try to keep the scripts self-explanatory without background knowledge of my game

I hope the members of the Baby Slug Game Developer Club at UCSC will find this useful, reach out to me if something needs fixing or if you have any questions about anything.

P.S. this may not all be original code, as I tried to pull information from beginner-friendly websites so that you can easily refer back to these websites if you choose to!
